# elevator-react-native

This is a tiny React Native app that simulates the behavior of an elevator.


## About

The app uses some basic components and the react hooks to create the elevator logic. 
- It's possible to change route when the elevator is already running.
- The floor can only be called once, no matter if it's from inside or outside of the elevator.
- It supports dark and light modes (respecting the system preference).
